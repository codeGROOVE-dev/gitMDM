# Security Hardening Report

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive security audit and hardening of gitMDM codebase has been completed. All critical and high-severity vulnerabilities have been addressed while maintaining the core principle of "Security Through Inability."

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Command Injection Prevention
- **Agent**: Switched to using `bash -r` (restricted shell) for command execution
- **Agent**: Added context timeouts for all external command executions
- **Agent**: Removed dangerous shell metacharacter handling
- **Output Limiting**: Enforced 10KB output limit per check to prevent memory exhaustion

### 2. File System Security
- **Permissions**: Changed from 0755/0644 to 0700/0600 (restrictive permissions)
- **Path Traversal**: Added comprehensive path sanitization and validation
- **Path Verification**: All paths are verified to stay within intended directories
- **ID Sanitization**: Enhanced sanitizeID() to prevent directory traversal attacks

### 3. Input Validation & DoS Protection
- **Request Size Limits**: 1MB limit on HTTP request bodies
- **Field Length Validation**: Maximum lengths enforced for all input fields
- **Check Output Limits**: 10KB per compliance check output
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in timeout configurations

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- **API Key Support**: Optional API key authentication via X-API-Key header
- **Security Headers**: Added CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **HTTPS Ready**: Designed for deployment behind TLS termination

### 5. XSS & Injection Prevention
- **Template Security**: Go's html/template automatic escaping enabled
- **Content Security Policy**: Restrictive CSP headers prevent inline script execution
- **JSON Output**: Proper Content-Type headers on all API responses

### 6. Error Handling & Information Disclosure
- **Sanitized Errors**: Removed sensitive information from error messages
- **Proper Error Checking**: All error returns now checked and handled
- **Graceful Degradation**: Service continues operation despite individual check failures

### 7. Git Security
- **Command Validation**: Git arguments validated to prevent command injection
- **URL Validation**: Git URLs checked for dangerous patterns
- **Safe Operations**: Only allow known-safe git operations

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth
1. **Input Validation** - All user input validated and sanitized
2. **Least Privilege** - Components run with minimal required permissions
3. **Isolation** - Agent and server completely decoupled
4. **Immutable Audit Trail** - Git provides tamper-evident logging

### Security Through Inability
- Agent cannot execute arbitrary commands
- Server cannot control agents (one-way communication only)
- No persistent state beyond Git repository
- No privilege escalation possible

## Deployment Recommendations

### Required Security Configuration
```bash
# Run server with API key authentication
./gitmdm-server -git /path/to/repo -api-key "your-secure-key-here"

# Configure agent with API key
./gitmdm-agent -server https://server:8080 -api-key "your-secure-key-here"
```

### Network Security
- Deploy server behind HTTPS termination (nginx/caddy)
- Use firewall rules to restrict access to server port
- Consider mutual TLS for agent-server communication

### Operational Security
- Run as non-root user
- Use systemd sandboxing features
- Regular security updates of base system
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity

## Remaining Considerations

### Acceptable Risks
1. **No Built-in Encryption**: Relies on HTTPS for transport security
2. **Basic Authentication**: API key is simple bearer token (use HTTPS!)
3. **No Rate Limiting Library**: Basic timeout-based protection only

### Future Enhancements
- Implement mutual TLS authentication
- Add structured logging with security events
- Consider adding HMAC signatures for reports
- Implement comprehensive rate limiting
